# the-industry

This repository deploys to Vercel and is hosting a \_redirects file to redirect witepill.pw/_ to https://piratewires.com/_

To alias:

Go to domain registrar's DNS settings for theindustry.pw (Google Domains)
Create an ALIAS or ANNAME record pointing theindustry.pw to https://the-industry.vercel.app

Now traffic to theindustry.pw will hit the Vercel deployment first, and get redirected based on the \_redirects file.
